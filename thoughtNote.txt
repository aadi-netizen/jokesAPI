Applicatioin name: Jokes Applicatioin
type: API 
Description: It is an API Which server joke/jokes as per the request. 

Learnings: 

1. To tap a query passed with the request url use "req.query.qureyName" and not "req.body" as 
it constitute body of the request. The req.body contains data in various forms such as form data, json data, 
Multipart/formdata(for binary data: document,image),xml(like html), graphQl and custome data.
The Content-Type header in the HTTP request specifies the type of data in the request body, 
helping the server understand how to parse and process the incoming data.

2. Methods are always tapped as "property.methodName()".

3. An array of objects could sent as response directly as a single object.

â™¦ Doubts: 

1. Could entire server app be considered as an API?
